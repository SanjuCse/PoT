		<h2 class="text-center">About Page</h2>
		<p>With a career in the construction industry spanning over 40
			years, the founder of this software, Mr. Raju, has extensive
			experience managing and handling large, complex projects of multiple
			disciplines. Raju used conventional tools and systems through a
			manual process to track construction management tasks. Soon, he
			realized that there could be a better way to manage construction
			using technology. So, he started identifying opportunities to
			digitize various parts of the construction business. With the belief
			that this could revolutionize the construction industry, he
			formulated a company and began developing software with over 20
			highly skilled developers.</p>
		<p>After years of development and testing, we have evolved Project
			on Track software. We believe this is the most powerful software for
			managing workflow in the construction industry. With role-based
			security access, users can decide who gets access to which modules.
			In addition, being on the cloud, this software provides access to
			real-time data anytime, anywhere in the world. Using this software,
			you can mitigate risks and save money by taking corrective action
			earlier in the process.</p>
		<p>As a company, we are dedicated to providing world-class support
			to our clients. With teams spread across the globe, we can help our
			clients in different time zones. In addition, with great technology
			partners on board, we are developing video-based software tutorials,
			so everyone can take advantage of learning this software at their own
			pace, from the comfort of their own home.</p>
		<p>With Project on Track, we assist our customers in remaining
			ahead of the competition by managing their projects from start to end
			through a cloud-based, integrated construction management platform in
			a multi-user environment. Our innovative and unique software provides
			easy-to-use business tools and solutions that connect your field
			operations and office in real-time. We have headquarters in Sydney,
